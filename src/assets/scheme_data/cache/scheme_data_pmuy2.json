  "detailed_description": "In May 2016, the Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas (MOPNG), introduced the &quot;Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana 2.0&quot; in India. The Pradhan Mantri Ujjawala Yojana (PMUY) is a scheme launched by the Government of India in 2016 to provide free LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) connections to women from below-poverty-line households. The objective was to make clean cooking fuel such as LPG available to the rural and deprived households which were otherwise using traditional cooking fuels such as firewood, coal, cow-dung cakes, etc. The usage of traditional cooking fuels had detrimental impacts on the health of rural women as well as on the environment. <br> - The target under the scheme was to release 8 Crore LPG Connections to the deprived households by March 2020. - On 7th September 2019, the Hon'ble Prime Minister of India handed over the 8th Crore LPG connection in Aurangabad, Maharashtra. - The release of 8 Crore LPG connections under the scheme has also helped in increasing the LPG coverage from 62% on 1st May 2016 to 99.8% on 1st April 2021. - Ujjwala 2.0: Additional allocation of 1.6 Crore LPG Connections under PMUY Scheme with special facility to migrant households.
