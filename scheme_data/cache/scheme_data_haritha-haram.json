  "detailed_description": "<br> Haritha Haram is a flagship programme of the Government of Telangana, India, aimed at increasing the green cover in the state. The name Haritha Haram means &quot;green garland&quot; in Telugu, the official language of Telangana. <br> The main objective of the Haritha Haram programme is to increase the green cover of the state from the existing 24% to 33% by planting and nurturing millions of saplings every year. The programme also aims to create awareness among the public about the importance of preserving and protecting the environment. <br> The program was launched by Telangana Chief Minister Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao on 3 July 2015. It is one of the Telangana Flagship programmes to rejuvenate degraded forests, protecting these forests from threats such as smuggling, encroachment, fire and grazing. It adopted intensive soil and moisture conservation measures based on a watershed approach. <br> In the areas outside the existing forest, massive planting activities were to be taken up in areas such as; road-side avenues, river and canal banks, barren hills and foreshore areas, institutional premises, religious places, housing colonies, community lands, municipalities and industrial parks. <br> Specific duties and responsibilities are assigned to different committees to ensure the implementation of the programme in a well-designed way. These committees do regular field inspections and monitor the ongoing plantation and nursery works. The committees are the State-Level Steering Committee and the District-Level Monitoring and Coordination Committee. <br> At the village level, Haritha Rakshana Committees were formed to monitor the program under the Chairmanship of Gram Sarpanch. <br> The seedlings are monitored through geo-tagging. The Forest Department posts survival percentage details on the Department.",

    "The Haritha Haram programme has several benefits, including:",
    "Increased green cover: The main objective of the programme is to increase the green cover in Telangana, which has several benefits, such as improving air quality, reducing soil erosion, and providing habitat for wildlife. Mitigation of climate change: Trees absorb carbon dioxide, which is one of the primary greenhouse gases responsible for climate change. By increasing the green cover, the Haritha Haram programme can help mitigate the effects of climate change. Soil conservation: Trees play a critical role in conserving soil by reducing soil erosion, improving soil quality, and preventing desertification. Water conservation: Trees help to conserve water by reducing soil erosion, improving the water-holding capacity of soil, and reducing evaporation. Biodiversity conservation: By increasing the green cover, the Haritha Haram programme can provide habitat for a variety of plant and animal species, thereby promoting biodiversity conservation. Economic benefits: The programme can generate economic benefits through the creation of employment opportunities in the forestry sector, as well as through the production of non-timber forest products such as fruits, nuts, and medicinal plants. Health benefits: Trees have been shown to have a positive impact on human health by improving air quality and reducing stress levels.",
    "Overall, the Haritha Haram programme has several benefits for the environment, economy, and human health, and has been successful in achieving its objectives of increasing the green cover and promoting environmental conservation in Telangana."
