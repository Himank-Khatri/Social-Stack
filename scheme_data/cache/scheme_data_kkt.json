  "brief_description": "A initiative of Rajasthan State for the farmer to protect crops from damage caused by Nilgai and stray animals. Financial assistance will be provided to the farmers by the Rajasthan government for fencing their fields.",
  "detailed_description": "The Taarbandi Scheme for Fields was launched on July 21, 2017, under the auspices of the Agriculture Department of the Rajasthan government. The primary objective of this scheme is to safeguard farmers&amp;#39; crops from damage caused by stray animals. Many farmers face crop losses due to the intrusion of such animals into their unfenced fields, particularly those who lack the financial means to secure their land. To address this issue, the Rajasthan Taarbandi Scheme was introduced, offering financial assistance to farmers across the state for the installation of fencing around their fields. This initiative aims to enable farmers to protect their crops effectively by erecting barbed wire enclosures around their fields. &lt;br&gt; > **Priority** - Scheduled Caste 17.83 percent, - Scheduled Caste 13.48 percent, - Women category farmers will be given priority for 30.0 percent participation.",
