  "eligibility_criteria": "The universe of eligible beneficiaries under PMAY-G will include all the houseless households living in zero, one, or two-room houses with kutcha walls and kutcha roofs (as per SECC data, and subject to the exclusion process).\nCriteria for Automatic/Compulsory Inclusion - \n1. Households without shelter\n2. Destitute/ living on alms\n3. Manual scavengers\n4. Primitive Tribal Groups\n5. Legally released bonded laborer\nPrioritisation within the Universe\ni. There will be multilayered prioritization within the universe of eligible PMAY-G beneficiaries. Priority will first be assigned on the basis of parameters reflecting housing deprivation in each category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others.\nii. To begin with, households will be prioritized based on houselessness followed by the number of rooms; zero, one, and two rooms, in that order.\niii. In a particular social category viz., SC/ST, Minorities, and Others, households that are houseless or living in houses with a lower number of rooms shall not be ranked below households living in houses with a higher number of rooms.\nWithin the above priority groups, households that fulfill the criteria of \"compulsory inclusion\", will be further elevated. Automatically included households shall not rank lower than other households within a priority group. Inter-se priority within the two subgroups viz. households which are automatically included and otherwise will be determined based on their cumulative deprivation scores.\nThe scores will be calculated from the socio-economic parameters given below with each having equal weight:\ni. Households with no adult member between ages 16 to 59\nii. Female-headed households with no adult male member between ages 16 to 59\niii. Households with no literate adult above 25 years\niv. Households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member\nv. Landless Households deriving the major part of their income from manual casual labor\nvi. Households with higher deprivation scores will be ranked higher within the subgroups.\nNote:  To ensure that assistance is targeted at those who are genuinely deprived and that the selection is objective and verifiable, the housing deprivation parameters in the SECC data will be used for identifying households and then verified by the Gram Sabhas.\nEarmarking of Targets -\nFor SC/ST:\n60% of the target allocated to each State/ UT should be earmarked for SC/STs, subject to the availability of eligible beneficiaries. Within earmarked targets, the proportion of SC and ST is to be decided from time to time by the respective States/UTs. Further, the States/ UTs would be allowed to interchange targets between SC and ST if there are no eligible beneficiaries from either of the category and it is certified as such. In case all eligible SC and ST households are covered, the State/ UT targets would be allocated to beneficiaries from the 'Other' categories included in the Permanent Wait List drawn from SECC 2011.\nFor Minorities:\nFurther, as far as possible, 15% of the total fund would be earmarked for Minorities at the National Level for households. The allocation of targets for Minorities among the States/UTs will be on the basis of the proportionate rural population of Minorities in the respective State/UT as per Census 2011 data. Minorities notified under Section 2(c) of the National Commission for Minorities Act, 1992 are to be considered eligible for receiving benefits against Minority earmarks.\nFor PwDs:\nAccordingly, in the scheme of PMAY-G, while deciding the inter-se priority among the beneficiaries who are to be provided assistance, households with any disabled member and no able-bodied adult member have been accorded additional deprivation score so that such households are given priority while allotting the houses. Keeping in view the provisions of the Persons with Disabilities Act, of 1995, the States to the extent possible, may ensure that 3% of beneficiaries at the State Level are from among persons with disabilities.\nTie Breaker\nIn case there is a tie with more than one household within a subgroup having the same deprivation score, the households will be ranked according to priority on the basis of the following parameters:\ni. Households with widows and next-of-kin of members of defence/paramilitary/police forces killed in action.\nii. Households where a member is suffering from leprosy or cancer and People living with HIV (PLHIV).\niii. Households with a single girl child.\niv. Beneficiary families of the Scheduled Tribes and Other Traditional Forest Dwellers (Recognition of Forest Rights) Act, 2006, commonly known as the Forest Rights Act.\nv. Transgender persons.",
