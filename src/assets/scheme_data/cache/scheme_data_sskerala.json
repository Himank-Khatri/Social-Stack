  "detailed_description": "Sastraposhini is a programme envisaged by the Kerala State Council for Science, Technology and Environment (KSCSTE) for strengthening science education in schools of Kerala. Under the programme, model science laboratories are established in selected Government high schools of the State to provide a better learning environment. The programme was launched by KSCSTE in association with the Department of Education, Government of Kerala in the year 2003. So far, KSCSTE has successfully established more than 200 science laboratories throughout Kerala. Presently, KSCSTE has decided to implement the scheme only in government high schools of Kerala. **The objectives of the Programme are:** - To stimulate interest in science at the school level by the performance of experiments in Physics, Chemistry and Biology by students. - To provide hands-on experiments to students for observation, inference, interaction and self-designing of experiments. - To organize training programmes for the teachers to demonstrate scientific experiments. - To evolve a low-cost laboratory kit based on readily available material for the performing of a range of experiments.",
  "benefits": [
    "A total of \u20b98 lakhs is spent to establish Sastraposhini laboratories (Physics, Chemistry, and Biology) in one school with a fair share from KSCSTE. Training will be provided to selected teachers from Sastraposhini schools by eminent scholars/ academicians from different disciplines. Laboratory manuals and visual experimental aids and models will be provided to the selected schools. Training programme for teachers: Two teachers each in Physics, Chemistry, and Biology from Sastraposhini schools are invited to participate in a training programme. The trained teachers will be in charge of each laboratory. Scientists/academicians offer classes on creating science awareness, good laboratory practices, setting up of laboratories, and practical demonstrations. Based on the training received, the teachers will be encouraged to carry out innovative projects in science for children utilizing the facilities of Sastraposhini laboratories."

The supply of laboratory items directly to the schools will be done by the agencies selected by KSCSTE through an open tender process as per government rules. Step 05: KSCSTE will release the amount required for the purchase of laboratory items to the respective schools. Step 06: The HM/Principal shall intimate KSCSTE regarding the completion of the refurbishing activities, after which KSCSTE will entrust the selected firms to supply the laboratory items to the schools. The school authorities shall verify the quantity and other specifications of the delivered laboratory items as stipulated by the Council. Based on the satisfactory report of the HM/Principal, the Council recommends the release of the payments due to the concerned firms. Step 07: The project has to be completed within one year from the date of sanction. Any delay in the completion of the project shall be intimated to the Council at the earliest.
