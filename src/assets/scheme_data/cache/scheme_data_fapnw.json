  "detailed_description": "&amp;quot;Financial Assistance to Poor &amp;amp; Needy Widow Women&amp;quot; is a scheme by the Department of Social Welfare, Govt. of Manipur. The objective of the scheme is to provide social security by way of financial assistance to widows in the age group of 18-40 years as this group is not getting benefits under the Indira Gandhi National Widow Pension Scheme. In Manipur, there are many widows of this age group due to the armed conflict and HIV/AIDS. Therefore, this scheme is indispensable for such widows to prevent difficulties and hardships to bear the daily need for survival. Widows who are domiciled in Manipur and have been residing in Manipur for more than 5 years continuously preceding the date of application are eligible under the scheme. This is a State Sponsored Scheme and only the citizens who are domiciled in the State of Manipur can apply for this scheme. The application should be submitted through the respective District Social Welfare Officer. <br>",
