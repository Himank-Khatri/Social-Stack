This program provides a unique opportunity for students and research scholars from BBIN countries (Bhutan, India, Nepal, and Bangladesh) to gain practical experience in land port development, cross-border trade, passenger movement, and border issues. &lt;br&gt; Enhanced Collaboration: For the first time, the LPAI internship program extends invitations to talented students across the BBIN region, including India. This expansion promotes regional collaboration and facilitates the exchange of knowledge and perspectives on land port development within South Asia. ***Program Highlights:*** \u2022 Open to Students from BBIN Countries: The program welcomes qualified students from India and other BBIN countries, fostering a diverse and enriching learning environment. \u2022 Focus on Northeast India: We encourage applications from students interested in addressing land port development&amp;#39;s unique challenges and opportunities in India&amp;#39;s Northeast states. \u2022 Diverse Research Methods: Interns can engage in various research methods, including policy-oriented research, social impact assessments, and economic impact assessments.

The Authority focuses on deploying systems that address security imperatives at the Land Ports while facilitating cross-border trade. b) Acknowledging the growing interest and potential contributions from academic institutions and young scholars, the LPAI has expanded its Internship Program to include BBIN (Bhutan, Bangladesh, India, Nepal) countries. This expansion aims to foster regional collaboration and knowledge exchange by providing opportunities for talented individuals from BBIN nations to participate in LPAI projects. c) LPAI engages with young scholars from India and neighboring BBIN countries through this extended internship program. This initiative is a two-way street, facilitating the exchange of diverse perspectives, fresh ideas, and research support from a broader regional context. It offers an avenue for young scholars to contribute to projects of national and regional significance, thereby enhancing mutual understanding and cooperation among BBIN nations while providing insights into governmental operations and projects of national importance. &gt; **Duration** 1.
