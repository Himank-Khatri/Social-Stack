  "detailed_description": "The scheme \"Marriage Assistance to Daughters of Prisoners\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. The Government of Kerala has implemented this scheme which provides financial assistance for the marriage of the daughters of those who have been undergoing imprisonment for more than 2 years. The maximum amount of financial assistance will be \u20b930,000/- per person, during the first phase of the scheme as many as 20 such families will be assisted. When a person commits a crime and gets sentenced to imprisonment, his family is vulnerable to financial instability, poverty, debt, and potential housing disruption. They often get stigmatized and marginalized in society following the incarceration of a family member. Due to the poor financial conditions, the family members find it difficult to ensure proper education for their children and marry off their daughters. Therefore, the Government of Kerala has implemented this scheme for the upliftment of such a target population.",
