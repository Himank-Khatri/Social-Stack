A candidate seeking to undergo Commercial Pilot License Training must have passed Matriculation or Higher Secondary School Certificate or its equivalent examination and must possess all the academic and technical qualifications required by the institute in which the candidate intends to undergo training for admission to the Commercial Pilot License Training Course.

The assistance will be sanctioned only after receiving the consent letter from the training institute for admission of the candidate; the trainee will have to submit the cost estimates for his training obtained from that institute. If any of the relatives of the candidate desiring to undergo such training are living abroad, the trainees should not be sponsored for financial responsibility by them. The applicant shall be free to repay the due amount earlier than the due date. If the applicant uses this loan for any other purpose, the loan amount will be recovered from the date of repayment (together with penal interest). The beneficiary has to furnish two valid sureties. Note 01: After completion of training the beneficiary will have to render his services in India for a minimum period of five years. If they settle abroad, the entire amount of such assistance will have to be returned to the Government of Gujarat with interest. There will be no relaxation in this. Note 02: The amount provided under this scheme will be limited to the amount actually required for training. The amount for training in India will include tuition fees and other incidental expenses. The decision of the Director, Scheduled Caste Welfare in this matter shall be final.
