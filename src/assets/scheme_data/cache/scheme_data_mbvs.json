  "brief_description": "The government of Punjab launched Mai BhagoVidya Scheme in the State during 2011-12.",
  "detailed_description": "Mai Bhago Vidya Scheme aims to ensure that the girl's students continue their education beyond the level of primary, to promote girl&#39;s enrollment, and reduce the dropout of the girl child in the senior secondary and higher secondary school level. The name Mai Bhago is one of the brave Sikh women soldiers who guided Sikh soldiers against the Mughals in 1705. She was the hero of that war because she killed a number of Mughals soldiers. In the State, most of the girls leave their education after 8th class because schools are far away from their homes. It is not easy for them to go to school without any vehicles and most families in Punjab villages cannot afford vehicles or bicycles for their girl's child. Mai Bhago Vidya Scheme helps those school-going girls who cannot afford the vehicles.",
