  "eligibility_criteria": "Only Indian citizens of all categories of holdings inclusive of corporates and cooperatives are eligible.\nReplanting activity is permitted up to a maximum extent of 25.00 ha per year / holding. However, the Board may vary the maximum extent to less than 25.00 ha depending on the availability of funds and demand for other components of the schemes. Applicable for Replantation of existing old / senile and low productive Arabica and Robusta coffee plantations aged 25 years in case of Arabica, 40 years in case of Robusta, 15 years in case of Arabica dwarfs by adopting either clean replanting or interlining in the existing blocks.Any exemptions can be referred to the concerned Joint Director (Extension) with details, to be decided in consultation with the Head Office. Inter-planting of Arabica in Robusta blocks with Robusta as main crop in case of clean replanting, the subsidy will be considered as per the Robusta norms. When interlined in the old blocks, the old / unproductive plants should be removed after one harvest. This would ensure proper establishment of new plants. Replacement of Arabica with Robusta at higher elevation of 1100 metres MSL and above is not eligible for support. In case of small, homestead farms where mixed cropping with more than 3-4 plantation crops is a general norm, the extent of area eligible for replantation subsidy for coffee will be calculated on pro rata basis on the number of plants replanted. For example: tall Arabicas planted at 6 x 6 ft spacing with square design should have 3000 plants for claiming subsidy equivalent to one hectare. Details regarding number of plants per unit area for different varieties and planting designs will be laid down by the Research Department of the Board. As far as possible, the growers should adopt appropriate planting designs that are suitable for mechanization of farm operations. In case of the estates which adopt planting designs amenable to mechanization, the subsidy will be considered for the entire area of replanting and not based on the plant population. Note : The scale of subsidy can be reduced to lower scale by the Board based on the demand and availability of budget under subsidy head. The level of applicable subsidy will be determined based on the total extent of area under coffee supported with relevant proof of land ownership records.   \n\n",
