The total annual income of the student's father/guardian should not exceed \u20b9 2,50,000/-.\n\nOTHER CONDITIONS\nIn addition to students studying in a recognised government educational institution located in Chhattisgarh, scholarships can be given in a limited number, based on merit, for regular study in BE/BTech courses in institutions outside the state approved by AICTE. Students regularly studying in institutions operated by a recognised university within the same campus will also be eligible for scholarships, even if they do not require AICTE approval. As per the provision made in rule 1, these scholarships will be given to eligible students for degree courses in engineering in national importance institutions of the country such as All India Institutes of Technology (IITs) and other higher technical institutions operated by the government (Central or State government) such as (NITs) and science education institutions such as (IISc), even if they do not require AICTE approval. Without special approval from the government, no student will receive more than one scholarship at the same time. However, if the institution where he is studying has given him any fee concession, then he will be entitled to continue receiving it. If any scholarship becomes vacant during its duration, then the approving authority can give such scholarships for its unexpired period to the next eligible and deserving candidate from the merit list. Only those students will be eligible to receive scholarships who have passed the qualifying examination from any testing body of Chhattisgarh. But children of such permanent government employees of Chhattisgarh can be exempted from this condition who are on deputation to the Government of India or any other state government. Such students will not be eligible to receive scholarships who are in full-time employment. In this regard, only one concession can be given that any such student who is regularly studying in a recognised institution and is receiving any scholarship can be allowed to do part-time work. In special cases not covered under the provisions of these rules, the government will provide special scholarships to eligible students at the rate prescribed for each course of study, based on poverty and merit. The total annual expenditure incurred in this regard will not exceed the budget limit.",
