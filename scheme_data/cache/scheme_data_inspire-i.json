  "detailed_description": "INSPIRE INTERNSHIP aims to provide exposure to the top 1% of students at the Class X Board level by organizing Science Camps either during summer or winter which provides an opportunity for them to interact with Science icons from India and abroad, including Nobel Laureates, to experience the joys of scientific pursuit. These science camps nourish the curiosity of students in science, help them to think out-of-the-box, and attract students at an early age of 16-17 years to choose science subjects for further studies. Annually 50,000 students who are among the top one percent in their X Board Examination and pursuing science in standard XI would be benefited through summer/ winter camps. These camps would nourish the curiosity of children in science; help them to think out of the box and attract the students at an early age of 16-17 years (i.e. in XI standard) to pursue a research career.",

    "Duration of the Summer/Winter Camp: 5 days (excluding the days of Journey) Nature of the Camp: Residential except in Metropolitan Cities  For the Interns: Each day the schedule of the Program should comprise at least two lectures cum discussion of one and a half hours in the morning hours followed by hands-on experience in the second half (i.e., 1400Hrs to 1730hrs). The coordinator should engage students in the thinking process on issues of national importance by way of organizing sessions for interns for writing on new and innovative ideas. The following are some of the key areas of priority: Second Green Revolution; Renewable and non Renewable energy; Clean energy; Natural resources utilization for sustainability; Make in India; Swachh Bharat & Ganga Rejuvenation; Energy conservation efficiency and sustainability; Harnessing Modern Technology for the second green revolution; Dairy and Livestock Sector; Solid & Liquid Waste Management; Recycling & processing of waste to conserve resources. The program Coordinator can organize a pre-dinner interactive session with the students on the first day and initiate discussions about the role of science and technology in the development of the nation. A session with the participating interns on writing new and innovative ideas on the above areas. The organizer shall evaluate these ideas by the external mentors present during the 4th or 5th day and select the best three write-ups in the raking of 1st 2nd 3rd \u2026.. 10th. The interns whose write-ups will be selected for 1st-10th rank will be awarded during the valedictory function. Each visiting Nobel Laureate has to interact with the Interns. Pre-dinner Discussions of INSPIRE interns with Mentors may be arranged each day. Lab infrastructure in the area of Physics, Chemistry, Life Science, Earth Sciences Mathematical Sciences, etc., Auditorium with sound system, Guest House, Hostel accommodation for boys and girls.  For the Organizers/Mentors: For the INSPIRE Internship camp of 5 days (excluding the Journey days), \u20b9 6500/- student (as an uppermost ceiling/student) will be provided to the coordinating Institute/Department/agency to meet the INSPIRE Internship camp cost.
