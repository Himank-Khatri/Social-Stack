  "brief_description": "The scheme \"Varnam Scheme for Transgender Students Pursuing Distance Education Courses\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala to provide financial assistance to Transgender students pursuing Degree/Diploma/ PG courses through distance education.",
  "detailed_description": "The scheme \"Varnam Scheme for Transgender Students Pursuing Distance Education Courses\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. The Government has started this scheme for supporting Transgender students which provides financial assistance to Transgender students pursuing Degree/Diploma/ PG courses through distance education. Several Transgender students are not able to study regular courses in colleges but instead pursue Degree/Post Graduate courses via distance education. Due to their deprived financial conditions, they are unable to meet the expenses incurred for payment of Registration fees, Tuition fees, Exam fees, study materials, etc. **Aims &amp; Objectives:** 1. Majority of the transgender persons are either dropouts or discontinue education in the early stages and due to the stigma the family members also disown them. Since they are unable to find a sustainable livelihood, they suffer financially. This scheme will support transgender students to complete their education successfully and earn a decent living and make them financially independent. 1. With the help of this distance education scheme, transgender students will be able to pursue their desired courses. 1. Transgender persons who are eligible for higher studies can complete their education and secure a decent job to lead a dignified life. This will encourage them to be self-sufficient and will open up a world of opportunities for such a target population.",
