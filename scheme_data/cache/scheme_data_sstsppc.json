  "brief_description": "The scheme \"Saphalam Scheme for Transgender Students Pursuing Professional Courses\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala.",
  "detailed_description": "The \"Saphalam Scheme for Transgender Students Pursuing Professional Courses\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. The Transgender community faces severe problems such as discrimination and infringement of rights. It is the responsibility of the government to provide special privileges to such target groups, bringing them to the mainstream of society by ensuring social rehabilitation. Due to a lack of proper education and social stigma in society, the Transgender community is also subjected to severe unemployment. Thus, the Social Justice Department has rolled out this innovative scheme that provides financial assistance to Transgender students pursuing Degree/Diploma level professional courses. This scheme would provide an opening to Transgender students who possess high technical/professional competence. Those students who have qualified for such professional courses and suffer from financial constraints can continue their education uninterrupted which in turn would increase their employment opportunities and help them to secure a good job and thereby lead a quality life.",
