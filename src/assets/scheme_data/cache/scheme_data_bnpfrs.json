This scheme functions as a sub-component of the broader National Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe Hub (NSSH) program. <br> The Bank Loan Processing Fee Reimbursement Scheme provides crucial financial assistance by reimbursing a substantial portion of the processing fees charged by financial institutions (FIs) when SC/ST MSEs secure business loans.
