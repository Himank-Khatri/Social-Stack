  "detailed_description": "The Department of Animal Husbandry, Government of Himachal Pradesh has introduced a scheme named &amp;quot;**Krishak Bakri Palan Yojna**&amp;quot; with the aim to increase income generation opportunities for economically weaker segments of the society as well as to increase meat production. Goat farming is a traditional occupation of economically weaker segments of the society (small and marginal farmers, mainly nomads and landless laborer&amp;#39;s) in Himachal Pradesh. This species is considered to be major source of economic sustenance for these categories of people. Adaptability of goats to wide range of agro climatic conditions has rendered it suitable for poor farmers. Under this scheme it has been proposed to distribute units of 11 goats (10 females +1male), 5 goats (4 females +1 male) and 3 goats (2 females +1 male) of Beetal/Sirohi/Jamanapari/White Himalayan breeds on 60% subsidy. **Objectives of this scheme:** 1. **Increase Income Generation:** The scheme aims to enhance income generation opportunities for economically weaker sections through goat farming. 1. **Boost Meat Production:** By providing high-quality goat breeds, the scheme aims to increase meat production in the state. 1. **Support Economically Disadvantaged Families:** The scheme offers a 60% subsidy on goat units, making it easier for financially weaker families to start goat farming. 1. **Promote Rural Development:** Encouraging goat farming contributes to the overall development of rural areas in Himachal Pradesh. 1. **Ensure Sustainable Livelihoods:** The scheme provides a sustainable livelihood to small farmers and landless laborers, reducing their economic vulnerability.",
