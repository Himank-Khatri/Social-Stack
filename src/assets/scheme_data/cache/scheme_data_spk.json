  "detailed_description": "The &quot;Sinchai Pipeline Karyakram&quot; under The Agriculture Department of the Rajasthan government will provide subsidy to farmers on purchasing irrigation pipelines. So that farmers can get rid of the problem of irrigation. And their income can increase. There are many farmers in our country whose financial condition is weak and are unable to buy pipelines, due to which their crops get ruined due to lack of water. To overcome the problem of irrigation, many types of schemes are also being run by the Central and State Governments. In this direction, considering the problems of farmers. <br> > **Feature :** 1. Farmers will be eligible for a grant only if they purchase BIS-marked pipes from a manufacturer or their authorized distributor/seller registered with the Agriculture Department, either in cash or by taking a loan from a bank, and successfully install them on their farm. 1. Each pipe distributed on a grant basis must be embossed with the year of manufacture and the grant distribution year. The grant will be admissible only on pipes manufactured and sold in the eligible year. Additionally, the grant will be admissible on the remaining pipes from the previous year in the next financial year as well. 1. The concerned manufacturer will necessarily provide information about the remaining stock of the previous financial year to the Deputy Director and Assistant Director of Agriculture (Ext.) office in the district. The grant will not be admissible in the absence of information. 1. In the financial year, the list of maximum retail price (MRP) of pipes will be sent by the pipe manufacturers to the Deputy Director and Assistant Director of Agriculture (Ext.) office through selected dealers in the district.
