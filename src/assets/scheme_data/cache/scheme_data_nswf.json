    "Here are the features and benefits that this government scheme for fishermen offers -",
    "Housing Facility",
    "The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen offers fishermen facilities for constructing houses. There is no upper limit for building homes in a particular village as it entirely depends on the number of fishermen residing. States through this scheme ensure equal distribution of houses among all fishermen. Also, this government-backed scheme dictates the house construction with a base area within 35 sq. mt. Also, the cost must not exceed \u20b975,000.",
    "Construction of Common Facility",
    "This government-backed scheme ensures building a community hall in some instances if there are more than 75 houses in a village. This scheme will build a community hall (with two toilets and a tube well) with a base area measuring 200 sq. mt. and within \u20b92 lakh. Fishermen can use this community hall as a mending shed and a drying yard.",
    "Assurance of Clean Drinking Water",
    "This scheme offers a tube well for every 20 houses. Also, depending on the requirement, the number of tube wells is increased. In addition, this scheme provides an alternative option where tubewell installation is not possible.",
    "Insurance Facility",
    "(For Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen)- This scheme provides fisherfolk or licensed or identified or registered with the States or Union Territory \u20b950,000 in case of death or permanent total disability. Also, this scheme provides \u20b925,000 for partial permanent disability.",
    "Here, the insurance cover will continue for 12 months, and FISHCOPFED would take out a policy. Also, under this scheme, the affected fishermen will have to pay an annual premium worth \u20b915 (per head). Here, the Central Government will pay 50%, and the State Government will pay the remaining 50% subsidy as grants-in-aid. In the case of Union Territories, the Central Government will bear a 100% premium.",
    "On the other hand, those States/UT's, which subscribed to this Group Accident Insurance for Active Fishermen through FISHCOPFED, will get a Central share of assistance (100% premium for Union Territories) directly through FISHCOPFED and not through States/UT's.",
    "Saving cum relief",
    "The National Scheme of Welfare of Fishermen further offers a savings cum relief scheme. This scheme component collects \u20b975 from marine fishermen for 8 months in a year. Total \u20b9600 needs to be collected to match an equal amount worth \u20b9600 provided by the State and Central Government to segregate on a 50:50 basis. If any fishermen fail to make payment, the authorities will refund the paid amount with interest at the end of the 4th month. Also, the \u2018lean months' provisions vary from a coastal area or marine area, which FISHCOPFED decides entirely.",
