  "detailed_description": "The \"Go-Green Three Wheelers Scheme\" is implemented by the Gujarat Building and Other Construction Worker's Welfare Board (GBOCWWB), Labour, Skill Development &amp;amp; Employment Department, Government of Gujarat. Under the scheme, a one-time subsidy will be provided on the purchase of battery-operated tricycle (e-rickshaw) vehicles to registered construction disabled workers. **Objective:** If a registered construction worker becomes disabled or incapacitated due to an accident while working at a construction site, the income of the construction worker ceases. So the construction worker is permanently financially unable to support the family. In such a situation, the use of three-wheelers is intended to help the construction workers as a source of income so that they can find other employment and support their families.",
