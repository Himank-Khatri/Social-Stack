The students with the specified disabilities defined in Schedule of the &quot;Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016&quot; will be eligible under this scheme. This includes persons with visual, hearing, speech, loco-motor, mental retardation, and other disabilities. <br> At times SwDs are deprived of harnessing their latent skills and thereby miss the opportunity.
