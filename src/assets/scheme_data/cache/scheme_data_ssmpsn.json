  "brief_description": "The scheme \"Snehayanam Scheme for Mothers of Persons with Special Needs\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala.",
  "detailed_description": "The scheme \"Snehayanam Scheme for Mothers of Persons with Special Needs\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. Under the scheme, Electric Auto Rickshaws will be provided free of cost to mothers of persons with disabilities who suffer financially. This scheme would provide a means of livelihood for such beneficiaries. During the initial phase of the scheme, 2 beneficiaries from each district will be selected for this scheme. The task of caring for and providing rehabilitation support for persons with autism, cerebral palsy, mental retardation, and multiple disabilities can be stressful and daunting for parents, especially mothers. Such persons with disabilities (PwDs) coming under the purview of the National Trust Act 1999 always require special care and attention since they cannot perform their day-to-day activities without someone else's assistance. Sometimes taking care of such PwDs can be quite challenging for widowed or divorced mothers with no other source of permanent income.",
