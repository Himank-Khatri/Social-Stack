  "detailed_description": "MIDH covers horticulture items such as, fruits, vegetables, root &amp; tuber crops, mushrooms, spices, flowers, aromatic plants, coconut, cashew, cocoa and bamboo. It is a Centrally-Sponsored Scheme covering all states and UTs. MIDH also provides technical advice and administrative support to State Governments/ State Horticulture Missions (SHMs) for the other horticulture related activities. **Area of Operation &amp; Funding pattern:** <br> S. No.Sub-schemeArea of OperationFunding pattern1National Horticulture Mission (NHM)All states and Union territories except NE and Himalayan states/UTs60:402Horticulture Mission for North-East &amp;amp;amp;amp; Himalayan States (HMNEH)NE and Himalayan states/UTs90:10<br> National Horticulture Mission (NHM) was launched in the year 2005-06 and aims at the holistic development of the horticulture sector by ensuring forward and backward linkage through a cluster approach with the active participation of all stakeholders. Major interventions under NHM include, supply of quality planting material through establishment of nurseries and tissue culture units, production and productivity improvement programmes through area expansion and rejuvenation, technology promotion, technology dissemination, human resource development, creation of infrastructure for post harvest management and marketing in consonance with the comparative advantages of each State/region and their diverse agro-climatic conditions. <br> Horticulture Mission for North East and Himalayan States (HMNEH) aims to achieve overall development of Horticulture in NE and Himalayan states. The mission covers all NE States including Sikkim and three Himalayan states of Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. <br> Executive Committee of MIDH decides the annual outlay to various implementing agencies (SHMs and NLAs). Accordingly, implementing agencies submit an Annual Action Plan (AAP) for the approval supported with data/write up on outcome of past interventions and also covering the details of various interventions proposed to be taken up during the current financial year. While finalizing the AAPs, due attention is paid for earmarking specific targets for Scheduled Caste, Scheduled Tribe and women beneficiaries. As an inbuilt provision under MIDH scheme, higher rates of subsidy have been envisaged for taking up activities like creation of infrastructure for post-harvest management and marketing of horticulture produce along with area expansion by beneficiaries in the North Eastern States, Himalayan States, Tribal Sub Plan areas, Andaman &amp; Nicobar and Lakshadweep Islands. The key objectives of the Mission are as follows: \u2022 Promote holistic growth of horticulture sector, including bamboo and coconut through area based regionally differentiated strategies, which includes research, technology promotion, extension, post-harvest management, processing and marketing, in consonance with comparative advantage of each State/region and its diverse agro-climatic features \u2022 Encourage aggregation of farmers into farmer groups like FIGs/FPOs and FPCs to bring economy of scale and scope. \u2022 Enhance horticulture production, augment farmers, income and strengthen nutritional security; \u2022 Improve productivity by way of quality germplasm, planting material and water use efficiency through Micro Irrigation. \u2022 Support skill development and create employment generation opportunities for rural youth in horticulture and post-harvest management, especially in the cold chain sector. Under MIDH, financial assistance is provided for following major interventions/activities: \u2022 Setting up of nurseries, tissue culture units for production of quality seed and planting material. \u2022 Area expansion i.e. Establishment of new orchards and gardens for fruits, vegetables, and flowers. \u2022 Rejuvenation of unproductive, old, and senile orchards. \u2022 Protected cultivation, i.e. poly-house, green-house, etc, to improve the productivity &amp; grow off season high value vegetables and flowers. \u2022 Organic farming and certification. \u2022 Creation of water resources structures and watershed management. \u2022 Beekeeping for pollination. \u2022 Horticulture Mechanization. \u2022 Creation of Post-Harvest Management and Marketing infrastructure.",
