    "Benefits :",
    "Hassle-Free Process: Individuals can open their accounts at any post office or authorized bank in India. SCSS Tax Benefits: Under Section 80C of the Income Tax Act, the principal amount invested in this scheme is eligible for deduction up to a limit of \u20b91.5 lakhs in a year. Furthermore, interest earned on SCSS is taxable according to an individual's tax slab. However, if the amount exceeds \u20b950,000 for a fiscal, TDS (Tax Deducted at Source) is applicable. High-Interest Rate: SCSS offers an interest rate of 7.4% per year.",
    "Features :",
    "Varying Interest Rates: The SCSS interest rate is modified once in every 3 months. Therefore, this rate of interest is subject to revision 4 times in a year. Assured Returns: The returns on this scheme are issued as it is a government-backed instrument. Moreover, contrary to market-linked investments, which are subject to fluctuations, SCSS is safe and offers assured returns to individuals. Maturity Duration: SCSS comes with a maturity period of 5 years. That said, one can extend the scheme for another 3 years by submitting a duly filled-up Form B. Nonetheless, in this regard, the interest rate as per the quarter is levied. Deposit Limit: Individuals can deposit a minimum of \u20b9 1,000 to open their accounts. Moreover, one can deposit \u20b9 15 lakh or the amount of retirement benefit, whichever is lower. Account Closure: Deductions are made against premature withdrawals. If closed before a period of 2 years, 1.5% deduction will be made as a penalty. Furthermore, if closed after 2 years, 1% is deducted. However, for extended accounts, one can withdraw funds post one year without attracting penalties. Quarterly Disbursals: One can expect quarterly disbursements against the deposited amount. The interest gets credited to the account on the 1st of April, July, October, and January. Nomination Option: The account holder can register a nominee to the Senior Citizens Saving Scheme. So, if the account holder passes away before maturity, the nominee will receive the due amount."
