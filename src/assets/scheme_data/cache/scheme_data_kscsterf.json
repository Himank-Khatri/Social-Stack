There are seven science streams in which the students can opt for fellowship.

Under the scheme, the fellows are selected based on a rigorous online examination among bright post-graduate students. The following is the pattern of examination: **There are two papers for the entrance examination:** - Paper A is general which evaluates the candidate's general knowledge and research aptitude. - Paper B is the subject paper. The syllabus for paper B is similar to that of the CSIR examination and this will be available on the KSCSTE website. **Pattern of Examination****Part A (General Aptitude)****Part B (Subject)**Total Questions20100Max no. of questions to attempt2050 - There is no negative mark. - The total marks will be calculated as follows: - Out of 90 total marks, 70 marks are from the online examination and 20 marks from the Post-graduation degree marks. - The cut-off marks for selection to the fellowship are based on the number of fellowships available for each stream. For reservation candidates (SC/ST, persons with disabilities), there will be a 5% reduction in cut-off marks from that of the general (UR) / General-EWS and OBC candidates. - The maximum number of fellowships in each subject is given below: **Subject****No. of Fellowships**Life Sciences28Chemical Sciences16Mathematical Sciences10Physical Sciences 16Earth, Atmospheric, Ocean, and Planetary Sciences10Environmental Sciences 10Engineering Sciences10Total100 - The number of fellowships may vary based on the availability of funds. - The selected candidates will be intimated by e-mail and post.
