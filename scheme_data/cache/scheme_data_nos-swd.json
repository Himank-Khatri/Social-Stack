  "detailed_description": "A scholarship scheme by the Ministry of Social Justice &amp; Empowerment for regular, full-time students with disabilities to obtain higher education viz., Master&#39;s degree, or Ph.D. courses from foreign universities, in one of the specified fields of study. <br> The students with the specified disabilities defined in Schedule of the &quot;Rights of Persons with Disabilities Act, 2016&quot; will be eligible under this scheme. This includes persons with visual, hearing, speech, loco-motor, mental retardation, and other disabilities. NOS is implemented offline by the DEPwD. <br> At times SwDs are deprived of harnessing their latent skills and thereby miss the opportunity. This scheme aims to support SwDs to study further in order to prepare themselves to earn their livelihood and to find a dignified place for themselves in the society as they face several barriers physical, financial, psychological, mental in pursuing studies and living with dignity. <br>",
