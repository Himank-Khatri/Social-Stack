  "detailed_description": "Chief Minister's Solar Rooftop Capital Incentive Scheme is a capital subsidy scheme by the Tamil Nadu Government. In this scheme, a capital subsidy of \u20b9 20,000 per kilowatt is provided for grid-connected domestic solar PV systems in addition to the 30% subsidy scheme* of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of the Government of India. For individual homes/flats, the solar system capacity shall be 1 kW. For the residential flats solar system capacities of 5 kW, 10 kW, and multiples thereof can be applied for common usage as a group application.

    "A capital subsidy of \u20b9 20,000 per kilowatt for grid-connected domestic solar PV systems in addition to the 30% subsidy scheme* of the Ministry of New and Renewable Energy (MNRE) of the Government of India. For individual homes/flats, the solar system capacity shall be 1 kW. For the residential flats solar system capacities of 5 kW, 10 kW, and multiples thereof can be applied for common usage as a group application. (* limited to 30% of MNRE benchmark cost or 30% of the project cost, whichever is less) You may opt for any capacity out of 1, 2, 5 & 10 kWp, but the subsidy will be limited to 1kWp per house / flat. A grid-connected photovoltaic power system will reduce the power bill due to the import and export of power through net metering provision. Illustration: someone imports (consumes) 1,000 kWh from the grid and exports 600 kWh to the grid in a billing cycle. The energy bill will be for 400 kWh (1000 kWh \u2013 600 kWh) accounted by Netmeter. Grid-connected PV systems do not require batteries. Batteries are costly require periodic maintenance and also lead to the wastage of 15 \u2013 20 % of energy in storage and retrieval. Grid-connected PV systems are much easier to operate and maintain. Segregation of load is not required."
