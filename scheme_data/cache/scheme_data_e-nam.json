Implemented by the Small Farmers Agribusiness Consortium (SFAC) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers' Welfare, Government of India, the platform streamlines agricultural marketing by offering single-window services such as commodity arrivals, AI-based quality assaying, e-bidding, and direct e-payment to farmers. It aims to enhance transparency, efficiency, and competitiveness in agricultural trade while expanding market access for farmers and reducing information asymmetry. In Jammu &amp; Kashmir, 11 mandis, including Narwal (Jammu) and Parimpora (Srinagar), have been integrated with e-NAM since May 2020. <br> > **Key Objectives:** - Facilitate nationwide integration of markets through a common e-platform for agricultural trade. - Standardize marketing and transaction procedures across all APMC mandis. - Expand farmers' access to buyers and markets for better price discovery and reduced information gaps. - Promote quality-based bidding through the establishment of assaying systems. - Ensure stable pricing and availability of quality produce to consumers. <br>",
