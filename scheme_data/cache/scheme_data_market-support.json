Wherever the Government agencies market the coffee of the growers the subsidy shall be released to the agencies directly through NEFT / PFMS. Wherever the FPOs / Co-operatives market their coffee, the subsidy shall be released to the individual members directly to their bank account through PFMS in cases where the application is complete in all respects.  Amendment to the Scheme: The submission of application by the applicant or acceptance of the application by the office does not automatically entitle the applicant for the eligible subsidy from the Coffee Board. The release of eligible subsidy to the applicant is subject to availability of funds during a particular year. Applications of persons who resort to making offers, rewards, gifts or any material benefit, or any coercion either directly or indirectly, to influence the sanction process shall summarily be rejected. Similarly, legal action will be initiated for recovery with applicable interest against applicants who obtain the subsidy benefit by wilfully furnishing wrong/incorrect information, misrepresentation and suppression of information."
