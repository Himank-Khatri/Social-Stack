  "detailed_description": "Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) is a skill certi\ufb01cation component to enable Indian youth to take on industry relevant skill certification which will help them to secure a better livelihood. Individuals with prior learning experience or skills can register themselves and get assessed and certi\ufb01ed under the RPL component of PMKVY. It focuses mainly on individuals engaged in unregulated sectors. <br> Project Implementing Agencies (PIAs) such as private and public sector expert bodies in the sector, Central and State Government ministries and their institutions and other agencies designated by MSDE/NSDC are being incentivised to implement RPL projects in any of the five models (RPL camps, RPL at employer's premises, RPL by demand, RPL with best-in-class employers and online RPL). <br> RPL has 12 hours of orientation. To address knowledge gaps, PIAs offer bridge courses to candidates along with the 12-hour orientation domain skills, soft skills and entrepreneurship tips and familiarization with the assessment process. <br> Any revisions made to these guidelines will be uploaded on the official website of PMKVY (www. pmkvyofficial.org). All stakeholders are advised to regularly check for amendments/changes, if any.",
