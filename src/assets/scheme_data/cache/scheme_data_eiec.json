  "detailed_description": "The scheme &amp;quot;Establishment of Integrated Educational Complexes&amp;quot; by the Directorate of Education, Government of Goa, aims to address the inadequate infrastructure and congested conditions faced by government-aided educational institutions in urban areas such as Panaji, Margao, and Mapusa within Goa. These complexes are envisioned as comprehensive educational hubs equipped with essential facilities like playgrounds and auditoriums, providing a conducive environment for learning. &lt;br&gt; The scheme envisages the setting up of Integrated Educational Complexes at Bambolim, Mapusa and Margao, initially at Bambolim. The Integrated Educational Complex is a unique approach to providing better education (with common facilities) to students coming from all backgrounds as it is observed that many of the schools located in Urban areas are functioning in congested areas/flats and do not have any space for infrastructure facilities such as playground, auditorium etc. which does not provide the right school atmosphere.",
