  "brief_description": "The ARUNDHATI scheme started on January 1, 2020. It will offer 10 grams of gold as a gift to every bride. The bride and Bridegroom can apply for the scheme before the wedding. The scheme will cost about Rs 800 crore annually.",
  "detailed_description": "Many parts of our country are plagued with social evils surrounding the girl child, like child marriage, female foeticide, dowry etc. But the Assamese society, from time immemorial, is fortunate to be free from such evils. Though there is no dowry system prevalent in Assam, the parent of every girl desires to give something to the girl during her marriage. The parents, irrespective of their social and economic status dream to bestow their children with love, blessings and gifts. But for many, these dreams remain unfulfilled due to their economic weakness. Gold is always considered auspicious and an asset. The parents believe that a gift of gold ornament would enhance their daughter's social and economic status. Objective: The Government of Assam has decided to introduce a New Scheme \"ARUNDHATI\" from the financial year 2019-20. The objective of the scheme is to facilitate the parents of the girl child who are economically not very sound, but like all parents desire to give some gold which is considered auspicious to their as gift daughters on her marriage. The Government desires to share the joy of such parents who are getting their daughters married by way of providing Rs. 40,000/- as a blessing to the daughters of these parents for purchasing Gold.",
