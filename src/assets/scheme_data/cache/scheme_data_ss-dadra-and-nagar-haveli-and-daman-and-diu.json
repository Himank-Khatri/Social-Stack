  "detailed_description": "The Union Territory of Daman &amp;amp; Diu and Dadra &amp;amp; Nagar Haveli has successfully launched the \"Swabhimaan Scheme\" scheme to tackle the problems of Malnutrition, Anemia, and other relevant issues. The Hon&amp;#39;ble Prime Minister launched the scheme in Daman on 25th February 2018 and Hon&amp;#39;ble Home Minister in Dadra and Nagar Haveli on 20th April 2018. Under this scheme, a take-home ration (7.5kgs nutritious) is provided every month to Pregnant Women, Lactating Mothers, and Sabla (Adolescent Category girls in the age group of 11-14 years). The nutritional status of women and children in the Union Territory of Dadra and Nagar Haveli is alarming. The UT Administration decided to wage war against undernutrition and came up with the &amp;quot;Swabhimaan Scheme\" as one of the potent tools. The scheme builds on the Integrated Child Development Services (ICDS) being implemented by the government of India. One of the components of ICDS is the provision of supplementary nutrition to children, pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls. However, this nutrition was being provided as a cooked meal and the beneficiary had to visit the Anganwadi daily to avail of this benefit. Loss of wages or working time coupled with poor condition of Anganwadis, and poor attendance of Anganwadi workers led to low enrollment and poor uptake of supplementary nutrition. **Objectives:** - Improve the nutritional status of pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls - Provide a monthly quota of supplementary nutrition to pregnant women, lactating mothers, and adolescent girls on a fixed day of every month as a take-home ration. - Increase the number of beneficiaries availing of the scheme. - Increase attendance of women in the Anganwadis where they can also avail of benefits of other schemes and be made aware of health and hygiene issues. - Reduction in stunting, Premature deliveries, and low-weight babies.",
