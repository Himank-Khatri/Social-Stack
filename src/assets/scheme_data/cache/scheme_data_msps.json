  "detailed_description": "The scheme \"Matribhasha Satyagrahi Pension Scheme\" was launched by the Department of Information, Public Relations and Languages, Haryana on 12th December 2017. Under the scheme, the Government of Haryana is providing a monthly pension of \u20b910,000/- to the Matribhasha Satyagrahis of Hindi Aandolan-1957 due to whose struggle and sacrifices Haryana came up as a separate State on the map of India. In case, a Satyagrahi has already passed away, the monthly pension will be given to his/her surviving spouse. In the year 1957, a number of people from Hindi-speaking parts of erstwhile Punjab launched a crusade for the honour, promotion, and implementation of their mother tongue. This movement helped a lot in the creation of Haryana as a separate State. During this Satyagrah, Sh. Sumer Singh, a resident of village Naya Bans, District Rohtak even lost his life. These Matribhasha Satyagrahis were identified by constituting committees in all the districts of the State under the Chairmanship of the respective Deputy Commissioners concerned. The Deputy Commissioners, being the chairpersons of the committee, had got the record of Matribhasha Satyagrahis verified by the concerned Superintendents of Police by checking/verifying their record from the jails. - The Administrative Secretary of Information, Public Relations &amp;amp; Languages Department, Haryana will be competent to accord sanctions under this scheme. - The expenditure under this scheme will be borne by the Information, Public Relations &amp;amp; Languages Department, Haryana. After sanction by the Administrative Secretary of this department, the amount of pension will be deposited in the bank account of beneficiary Satyagrahi.",
