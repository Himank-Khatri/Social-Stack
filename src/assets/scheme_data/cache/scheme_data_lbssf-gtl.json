These applications are then sent to the head offices where the project proposal is appraised by SCA/RRBs/Nationalised Banks and the projects are sent back to NSKFDC along with recommendations. The Project Appraisal Committee of NSKFDC then appraises the proposals and after finding them in order places it in front of their board of directors for their approval. Once the board of directors approves the project, the letter of sanction is issued by SCAs/ RRBs/Nationalised Banks. Once all the terms and conditions have been accepted, the necessary documents and funds are then released to the concerned beneficiaries.
