  "brief_description": "The Telecom Technology Development Fund Scheme (hereinafter referred to as \u2018Scheme') has been notified for domestic companies and institutions involved in technology design, development, commercialization of telecommunication products and solutions to enable affordable broadband and mobile services.",
  "detailed_description": "Telecommunication technology products require significantly large funding and long gestation periods for R&amp;amp;D and commercialization including the additional efforts and resources for the products to move from prototype to commercial grade. In the cases of high-impact deep-tech projects, elaborated in later sections, there is a need for higher funding to build such products at an affordable cost to enable state of the art services for rural areas in the country. Taking note of this strategic need in the telecom sector and to create a large pool of capital available for R&amp;amp;D in the country, different financing instruments are offered under various schemes of the Government of India to develop indigenous technologies and solutions. Apart from the existing R&amp;amp;D funding mechanisms, annual collections under the Universal Service Obligation Fund (USOF) will also be utilized by the Department of Telecommunications (DoT) for funding research and development of technologies, products, and services for the purpose of providing telecom services in rural and remote areas. An allocation of 5% of annual collections from USOF will be available for funding R&amp;amp;D in the Telecom sector, starting with the funds collected in the financial year 2021-22. Commercialization and adoption of these telecom technologies and solutions developed shall be given priority including through USOF schemes. Induction of new technology developments in the telecom sector in rural and remote areas through pilots and trials. Deliverables are in line with the objectives, scope, and activities envisaged above. The impact of the Scheme would be measured in terms of: 1. Number of products, solutions, Use cases developed, commercialized and its market value; 1. Number of entities received educational order, culminating in getting full-fledged orders; and 1. Number of IPs generated and commercialized.",
