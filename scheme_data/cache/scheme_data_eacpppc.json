  "detailed_description": "The scheme \"Educational Assistance to Children of Prisoners (Pursuing Professional Course)\" was launched by the Department of Social Justice, Government of Kerala. To help the children of prisoners, the Government of Kerala has devised this scheme which provides educational assistance to children of prisoners up to degree-level courses as per G.O (RT) No. 322/2014/SJD dated 08-05-2014. When an individual gets convicted and punished for any crime it&amp;#39;s not only the person who suffers, the one who suffers the most are their children. They get deprived of all their rights; they face a lack of opportunities for education and a financial crisis. When compared to the present educational standards, the assistance provided to children pursuing degree-level professional courses in Government / Aided colleges is inadequate. Considering the different types of fee structures for professional courses, State Government has fixed the assistance amount for children of prisoners to \u20b9100,000/- (per student) including annual fees &amp;amp; hostel fees.",
