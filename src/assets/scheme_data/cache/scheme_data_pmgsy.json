The primary objective of PMGSY concerns building robust, all-weather roads in rural habitations and other core areas.

Since then, the funds have been divided between the Centre and the State. For North Eastern and Himalayan States (Jammu &amp; Kashmir, Uttarakhand, and Himachal Pradesh) 90% of a project is the Union Government funds, and 10% of this cost, is the State Government funds. For the Other States, the Union Government funds around 60% of a project while the remaining 40% is by State Government funds. <br> Some prominent features of PMGSY are - Proper decentralized planning for the building of roads. Build roads according to the Indian Road Congress and Rural Roads Manual. 3-tier quality management system. An unbroken flow of funds. <br> <br> <br> <br>",
