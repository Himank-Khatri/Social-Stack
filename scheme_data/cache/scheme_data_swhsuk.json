  "detailed_description": "The scheme &quot;Solar Water Heater Scheme&quot; by the Department of Renewable Energy, Government of Uttarakhand, aims to provide clean and affordable energy, reduce electricity bills, and contribute to environmental protection. Through this scheme, free electricity and a reduction in carbon emissions are provided to the residents of Uttarakhand. The scheme is implemented by the Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Agency (UREDA). <br> > **Objectives:** 1. To provide free electricity to consumers by reducing the burden of expensive electricity bills. 1. To contribute to the state&#39;s global clean energy initiatives and India&#39;s target of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7. 1. To promote energy conservation through the use of green energy. 1. To achieve maximum energy savings and an annual reduction in carbon dioxide emissions. 1. To reduce harm to nature caused by traditional methods of heating water, such as burning wood, especially in hilly regions.",
  "benefits": [
    "1. Financial Savings: Electricity consumers directly benefit from reduced expensive electricity bills, as electricity is procured at high rates by Distribution Companies (DISCOMs) for power supply during peak hours.",
    "2. Environmental Impact: Installation of solar water heaters contributes to the state's global clean energy initiatives and India's target of Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 7, which focuses on affordable and clean energy.",
    "3. Carbon Emission Reduction: For every 100% solar water heater installation, 1.5 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent emissions will be reduced annually, leading to a positive environmental impact.",
    "4. Reduced Deforestation: The use of solar water heater systems helps reduce the harm caused to nature by traditional methods of heating water (e.g., burning wood), particularly in the hilly regions of Uttarakhand.",
    "Conditions/Aspects/Criteria associated with the benefits:",
    "Grants are provided on a \"first come, first served\" basis to consumers under the sanctioned capacity of the power plant. Grant processing occurs after UREDA (Uttarakhand Renewable Energy Development Agency) verifies the installation. Final payment to the concerned installation firm is made only if UREDA's inspection is satisfactory.",
    "Mode of Disbursement:",
    "The grant amount will be transferred online to the account of the beneficiary/approved applicant by the concerned district's senior officer/project officer of UREDA."
